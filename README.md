# A Toolkit for Testing Voice Conversion Systems

A toolkit for evaluating Voice Conversion system outputs using EER, WER, and SNR metrics.

The ```proto``` directory contains biometric protocols based on the CHAINS, CommonVoice, libri-test-clean and VCTK datasets. All listed protocols contain pairs of trials and their corresponding labels. 
It is assumed that for every test file, the output of the Voice Conversion system will be used.
